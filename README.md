# C172R X-Plane Planner:

This is a very simple planner to quickly plan IFR flights. It will be updated frequently and many useful features are planned to make planning a C172 flight 
that much easier while still allowing for users to enjoy the flight planning software! It is aimed to help beginners and those wanting to avoid the nitty gritty physics involved 
with calculating fuel burn and timings. If you are like me you like to carry exactly what you need (plus some extra of course) and know ahead of time how long the flight will generally last.
While tools like skyvector and simbrief are great they are more for manual data entry--which is fine--but I was looking for something more tailored to the c172 such as climb times, fuel burn, and 
altitude measurements!

# Features
-Allows you to enter a flight plan
-Enter destination and arrival airport
-Enter altitude
-Calculates furl brun and fuel needed, timings between waypoints and navaids!

## NOTE::
This requires access to NAVAID files that include waypoints and airport data from every airport in the world.

I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO RELEASE THE NAVAID AND WAYPOINT DATA!!! I GOT IT FROM NAVIGRAPH WHICH IS A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION!!
